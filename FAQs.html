                            A personal alarm is a small hand-held electronic device with the functionality 
                            to emit a loud siren-like alarming sound. It is activated either by a button,
                            or a tag that, when pulled, sets the siren off.

                            Anyone can use a personal safety alarm.
                            <br>
                            Personal safety alarms can provide a sense of security in a number of situations 
                            and for a wide variety of people, however it is most commonly used by women. It can act 
                            as a deterrant when walking alone at night, travelling, walking your dog, or at an event.
                            <br>
                            These devices are especially popular to use in the UK as it's one of the only legal personal
                            defence systems you can use. 
                            <br>
                            These devices aren't only capable as acting as a deterrent, they can be used to 
                            notify family or the public if you fall over or out of bed, have a fit or when lost.

                            WatchU is both affordable and discrete.

                            Most other products are either obvious or expensive. With products that aren't 
                            discrete they may be identified and prevented from working prior to or after the
                            alarm is activated. 
                            <br> 
                            WatchU is available for £14.99 and is of far superior quality and design to
                            similarly priced devices- some similar products can cost up to £122!

                            Personal safety alarms should be used either to protect an individual in the 
                            case of a personal attack or emergency situation or for people to alert 
                            caretakers or the public that you are in need of emergency help.

                            The watchU produces an sound at 130dBs, this can be heard half a mile away!
                            <br>
                            Decibels (dBs) are a unit used to measure sound, the higher the number the louder
                            the sound. On the decibel scale an increase of 10 dBs means the sound is 10 
                            times louder! (130dBs is 10x louder than 120dBs).
                            <br> 
                            Here are a few examples of sources of 130dB noise:

                            <br> 
                            -A military jet aircraft take-off from 50ft away
